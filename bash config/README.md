### bash config

* **.bashrc** - contains *include* snippets, these should be placed near the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file
  * file location: ~/.bashrc
* **.bashrc_aliases** - contains custom bash aliases
  * file location: ~/.bashrc_aliases
* **.bashrc_custom** - contains any custom bash code, helps keep me from mucking up the real .bashrc with junk
  * file location: ~/.bashrc_custom
