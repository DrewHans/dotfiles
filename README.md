# dotfiles

It seems like I install a new Linux distro on my laptop at least three times a year. I almost always forget to copy my configs over, which means I have to rebuild them from scratch. I'm tired of losing my configs. So from now on, they live here. These are my dotfiles.

### Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub? (snippet from dotfiles.github.io)
* **Backup**, **restore**, and **sync** the prefs and settings for your toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine.
* **Learn** from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new tricks for the ones you already use.
* **Share** what youâ€™ve learned with the rest of us.
