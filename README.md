# dotfiles

It seems like I install a new Linux distro on my laptop at least three times a year. I almost always forget to copy my configs over, which means I have to rebuild them from scratch. I'm tired of losing my configs. So from now on, they live here. These are my dotfiles.

## [dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io/) snippet:
> ### Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?
> * **Backup**, **restore**, and **sync** the prefs and settings for your toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine.
> * **Learn** from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new tricks for the ones you already use.
> * **Share** what youâ€™ve learned with the rest of us.

[shellscripts](https://github.com/DrewHans555/shellscripts/) stores my shell scripts.

[txtfiles](https://github.com/DrewHans555/txtfiles/) stores my miscellaneous text files.
